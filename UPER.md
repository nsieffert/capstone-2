<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

* U = "Understand"
* P = "Plan"
* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
* Knowing that I had no idea how to accomplish this, I looked ahead in the coursework and discovered what the capstone would be.
* I began working on it early. If that counts against me, then no problem. Better to ask forgiveness and all that!
* I need to build a console game. But I have no idea where to start.
* Decide on a game - hangman seems simple enough.
* Think through the needs for hangman
	1. how to get the program to generate a secret word?
	2. how to get the user to input letters?
	3. how to get the program to decide whether it is valid or not.
	4. how to set up a valid count down for losing.
	5. how to signal when user wins.
	6. Would like to add a question - play again? Yes or no. How to do this?
* I know how to do user input, count increment, win/lose statements.
* Refer to notes for information on applying user input to the game.
* Refer to online tutorials for how to get the program to generate a random word.
* Refer to notes, course work and online help to put this all together.
* Get basic program working.
* Testing - enlist the grandkids to test for me.
* Need Error handling
* Decide on whether/how to conquer a user interface.
<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
* Decided on game and gathered notes.
* Found several tutorials on setting up a basic hangman game
	1. This was needed to understand how to get the program to pick a secret word. Learned about the Random function (not the Math.Random)
	2. This was also needed to understand how to apply user input to the screen with the little underlines.
* Set up loops and counter - decided on 6 tries, but would like counter to pause while the user is guessing correctly.
* Build on main and then separate out into components. Connect it all together.
* Add in error handling on user input.
* Add in "Play Again?" feature.
* Find a way to implement abstraction. - Getters?
*

<h2>
    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>
* Downloaded the project from GitHub
* Opened in Intellij
* Coded several iterations of the basic game in Main method until I got it working.
* Tested basic game - fixed/tested many times.
* Began separating out components to their own methods.
* Added in basic error handling on user input using Regex.
* Added in a quit feature. 
* Added in as much encapsulation as I could.
*Added in as much abstraction as I could.
* I am unclear where I could implement polymorphism since the game is pretty basic.
*Added in a couple of interfaces.
*Added in a lambda per requirements.
*Added in a stream, per requirements.
*Added in some colors to make it look better on the console.

    4. Reflection / Refactor
</h2>
* This was fun when I understood what I was doing. I just need more time to absorb the boatloads of information I have acquired over the last 9 weeks.
